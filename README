## General info
The site is built primarily Python, Flask, as well as a multitude of Flask extensions, HTML, CSS etc. 
The idea is for it to be able to connect Software Developers to volunteering opportunities, either
to pick up some experience with new skills, keep in touch with old skills, or simply help the community!

Users on the site can register as a unique user, log in, edit their personal information, and post their
opporunities.

Project is created with:
* Python 3
* Flask
* HTML5
